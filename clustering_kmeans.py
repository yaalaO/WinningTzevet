# init controls the initialization technique. The standard version of the k-means algorithm is implemented by setting init to "random". Setting this to "k-means++" employs an advanced trick to speed up convergence, which youâ€™ll use later.

# n_clusters sets k for the clustering step. This is the most important parameter for k-means.

# n_init sets the number of initializations to perform. This is important because two runs can converge on different cluster assignments. The default behavior for the scikit-learn algorithm is to perform ten k-means runs and return the results of the one with the lowest SSE.

# max_iter sets the number of maximum iterations for each initialization of the k-means algorithm.
